# CoT Tools

A collection of utilities for analyzing the cohesion-over-time (or alternatively, change-over time) of source files in git repositories.

## Usage

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now from inside this virtual environment, you can run any of the notebooks. You can also create your own notebooks / scripts that use the `cottools` package and run them.
